Greetings GitHub Community, I am a Youtuber
with a Alias Name known as PikachuFans2018, I
happen to be working on a Pokémon Fan Game
known as Pokémon Sorrel, I originally had a
Discord Server for the game but a thieving rule
breaker chose to implant a "virus" which freely
invited them into the server to mess with the
server and eventually take it over, and then
they took the ownership of the server from me
and gave it to someone else.
